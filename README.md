# WHAT IT IS


GStreamer plugin that wraps Kaldi's SingleUtteranceNnet2Decoder. It requires iVector-adapted
DNN acoustic models. The iVectors are adapted to the current audio stream automatically.

The iVectors are reset after the decoding session (stream) ends.
Currently, it's not possible to save the adaptation state and recall it later
for a particular speaker, to make the adaptation persistent over multiple decoding
sessions.


# HOW TO COMPILE IT

The following works on Linux (I'm using Debian 'testing').

Compile Kaldi trunk, using the shared configuration:
In Kaldi's 'src' directory:

    ./configure --shared
    make depend
    make

Install gstreamer-1.0:

    sudo apt-get install gstreamer1.0-plugins-bad  gstreamer1.0-plugins-base gstreamer1.0-plugins-good  gstreamer1.0-pulseaudio  gstreamer1.0-plugins-ugly  gstreamer1.0-tools libgstreamer1.0-dev

Now we can compile this plugin. Change to `src` of this project:

    cd src

Compile, specifying Kaldi's root directory:

    make depend
    KALDI_ROOT=/path/of/kaldi-trunk make

This should result in 'libgstkaldionline2.so'.

Test if GStreamer can access the plugin:

    GST_PLUGIN_PATH=. gst-inspect-1.0 kaldinnet2onlinedecoder


# HOW TO USE IT

Command-line usage is demonstrated in `demo/`.

Usage through GStreamer's Python bindings is demonstrated `demo/gui-demo.py`
and in the project
https://github.com/alumae/kaldi-gstreamer-server, in file kaldigstserver/decoder2.py.
